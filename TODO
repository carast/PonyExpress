GENERAL
[X] rename classes with OSC in name
[ ] use omgosc for functional tests
[ ] investigate using GCDAsyncUdpSocket instead of AsyncUdpSocket

MESSAGE
[ ] add initializers with vararg
[X] add param/arg enumerator that takes a block
[X] add more complete valadity checking for address via NSRegularExpression
[X] add cool debug method to dump bytes and ascii
[ ] make debug buffer dump multi-line and byte-gap configurable
[X] test Blob serialization
[ ] implement Timetag
[ ] do a better job with NSData allocation and writing in -_data
[ ] sort out bundles
[X] take a stance on unrecognized type tags
  considered an error, i'm not sure how we'd parse the arguments

SENDER
[X] create UDP connection
[X] tear down UDP connection on dealloc
[X] consider adding a means to connect/disconnect
[X] allow host and port changes when disconnected
  sockets cannot be reconnected
[ ] rename to denote as UDP
[ ] document 9k UDP limit and Blob use
[ ] consider connect on create, little use in offering separete connect/disconnect when one cannot reconnect anyways

RECEIVER
[X] create UDP connection
[X] generate message from received data
[X] implement receiver delegation protocol
[ ] consider connect on create, little use in offering separete connect/disconnect when one cannot reconnect anyways
[ ] rename to denote as UDP

TESTS
[X] look into OCMock for more testing
[ ] test message argument serialization
[ ] test message argument deserialization
[~] test sender with bad host
[X] test sender with privledged port, < 1024
[X] test sender on port in use
[X] test receiver with privledged port, < 1024
[~] test receiver on port in use
[ ] test send bad message data
[ ] test receive bad message data
[ ] functional tests for sender
[ ] functional tests for receiver

MISC
[ ] sample router? ?*[!-]{,}//
[ ] example message snooper

LATER
[ ] mDNS receiver announcement
[ ] consider a PEOSCValue class to wrap boxing
[ ] add socket management layer to allow sharing
[ ] static library option for iOS
[ ] add TCP and Serial sender/receiver classes
[ ] allow end points to be discovered through query proposal
